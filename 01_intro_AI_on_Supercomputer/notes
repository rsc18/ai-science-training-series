#Homework1:
Mini Batch Training:

1. Using the sample function of pandas:
    data_batch = data.sample(batch_size)

2. Go through entire dataset in one epoch:
    For one epoch, sample the dataset len(data)//batch_size
    It will roughly go through the entire data.

3. For each batches:
    compute gradient for parameters (here, m, b)
    update parameters m and b.

3. After one epoch is completed store the loss value to plot.
